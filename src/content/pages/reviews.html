                    Have been to see Noi here several times and always great. I‚Äôve been to most other Thai massage places in Gosforth and Jesmond and this is the best value. I get painful shoulders/legs and migraines and always feel better and relaxed after a visit here. She will fit you in short notice too which is amazing ü§©

                    Amazing massage and service! Very thorough and relaxing. She took the time to ask what my problem areas were and ensured to focus on them and also payed attention to the rest of the body. The tension and pain in my shoulders/neck have gone. Clean, tidy and spacious area. Can‚Äôt wait to book in again.

                    Fantastic real Thai massage just like you get in Thailand. I run and sit at a desk for work so get a lot of stiffness and pain in the legs, shoulders, back and neck. She really worked all spots and I felt like I had a new pair of legs running this morning. It's amazing how much energy a little Thai lady can generate. Highly recommended for people who do sports and are desk based.

                    Lovely and comfortable room. I felt very relaxed and she worked on all my knots and stiff joints and muscles. I came away feeling longer and lighter and had a great night sleep too üòÅ. Definitely recommend and I will definitely be going back for further treatment. üôè
